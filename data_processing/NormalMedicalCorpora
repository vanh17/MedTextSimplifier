Eye	21	Ocelli -LRB- pit-type eyes of arthropods -RRB- blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain .
Eye	21	Focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity .
Eye	18	The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encounteredâ '' hence increasing the resolution obtainable .
Eye	21	The ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point always lies behind the retina ; consequently they can never form a sharp image .

Hot chocolate	13	This powderâ '' much like the instant cocoa powder used todayâ '' was easier to stir into milk and water , and led to another very important discovery : solid chocolate .
Hot chocolate	1	The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the Mayan peoples around 2,000 years ago , and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD .
Hot chocolate	6	What the Spaniards then called `` chocolatl '' was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold .
Hot chocolate	14	Thus the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter , whose absence makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate , while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate .
Hot chocolate	14	In other places , a distinction is made between `` hot cocoa '' , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and `` hot chocolate '' , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar and cocoa butter .

Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
Pulmonary hypertension	13	Whatever the initial cause , pulmonary arterial hypertension -LRB- WHO Group I -RRB- involves the vasoconstriction or tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs .
Pulmonary hypertension	15	In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension -LRB- WHO Group III -RRB- , the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries . This leads to a similar pathophysiology as pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Pulmonary hypertension	14	Instead , the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently , leading to pooling of blood in the lungs .
Pulmonary hypertension	13	Therefore it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body , especially during physical activity .
The Mighty Boosh	1	Fielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up routine at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theater .
Tonsil	2	Like other organs of the lymphatic system , some believe them to be involved in helping fight off pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract infections , but there is no conclusive evidence to that effect .
Tonsil	1	The human palatine tonsils and the nasopharyngeal tonsil are lymphoepithelial tissues located near the oropharynx and nasopharynx , although most commonly the term `` tonsils '' refers to the palatine tonsils -LRB- that can be seen in the back of the throat -RRB- .

Game port	11	This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick -LRB- i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable -RRB- , using some normally `` unused '' pins , or changing the joystick 's circuits -LRB- and related software -RRB- to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs , thus giving up to 16 button combinations -LRB- albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down -RRB- or a combination of both techniques .
Game port	3	The typical implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator , which together form a sort of crude ramp-compare ADC , which needs to be periodically polled and reset at precise moments to read an input , something that must be done several times -LRB- generally above 30 -RRB- per second to provide a responsive game input , and the actual acquisition frequency and value typically depend on the joystick 's internal resistance , noise , CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor 's RC time constant .
Thermal expansion	42	Thermometers are another application of thermal expansion â '' most contain a liquid -LRB- usually mercury or alcohol -RRB- which is constrained to flow in only one direction -LRB- along the tube -RRB- due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature .

Viral life cycle	5	The host cell is now no longer useful to the virus , therefore the cell often dies and the newly produced viruses must find a new host .
